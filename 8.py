#TASK ONE NUMBERS AND VARIABLES
#8. If one data type value is assigned to ‘a’ variable and then a different data type value is assigned to ‘a’
#again. Will it change the value? If Yes then Why?

a = 5
print(a)
a = 5.5
print(a)

# Yes, because in python you can assign the values dynamically to the same variable
